# 🧠 Build Your Own AI-Powered Web App with Ollama + Flask — From Basement to Cloud

Welcome to your DIY AI app journey! In this post, we’ll build a local AI chatbot using [Ollama](https://ollama.com), Flask, and basic web tech — and we’ll show you how to securely expose it online using Cloudflare, and later scale it into the cloud.

## ⚡️ Why Host Locally?

Self-hosting Ollama means:
- Full data control and no cloud costs
- Instant feedback for developers
- Integrations with other tools (e.g., sensors, databases, internal data)

It’s great for researchers, educators, tinkerers, and developers.

## 🚀 Tech Overview

We’re combining:
- 🧠 **Ollama** – LLM runtime
- 🐍 **Flask** – lightweight Python web server
- 🧪 **JavaScript + HTML** – simple, usable frontend
- 🌐 **Cloudflare Tunnel** – secure HTTPS access without network risk
- 🐳 **Docker** – scale-ready deployment format

---

## 🔧 Local Setup

Follow the full instructions in the [README.md](./README.md) to get it running on `localhost:5000`.

You can also:
- Switch models (e.g. llama3, mistral)
- Customize responses
- Style the UI

## 🔐 Cloudflare Tunnel for Secure Access

Don’t want to open ports on your router? Use Cloudflare Tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5000
```

Now anyone can access your app through HTTPS — and it’s still local!

---

## 🌍 Ready for the Cloud?

You can move this app to any cloud provider:

1. Install Ollama on the VM
2. Pull this repo
3. Build Docker image and run container
4. Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy for HTTPS

---

## 🧠 What’s Next?

This starter project can grow fast:

- Add **Stable Diffusion** for image generation
- Use **voice input/output** for hands-free AI
- Connect to a **vector database** for RAG
- Build a **multi-user dashboard**
- Turn it into a **progressive web app** or mobile experience
